The video introduction of the WHO PASC project.
::: 

This project aims to implement a computational algorithm for defining long COVID patients based on the WHO definition, more details in @fig-intro. We provide different scripts to streamline multi-site implementation.

If your site is within the ENACT ontology, you will download the cases patient set from pre-defined queries. Demographic file will also be pulled from the loyalty score tables. Having the [loyalty score scripts](https://github.com/i2b2plugins/loyalty_cohort) implemented is a prerequisite for this work.

If your site is not within the ENACT network, please ensure that it contains patient information such as ICD10 codes, codes domain (either ICD10CM or ICD10PCS), start date and demographic details such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, CHARLSON INDEX, etc..

We will provide a docker container for local project implementation based on the data pulled.The recommended computer configuration is RAM\>64 GB. It may be possible to complete the process with lower memory (32 GB).
